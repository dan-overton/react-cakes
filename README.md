# React Cakes

This project uses React, Redux and Bloomer / Bulma to present a simple CRUD SPA.

As the project is based on create-react-app all task running is handled via npm scripts.
To start the app locally run npm start, to test it run npm t.

The app is continuously deployed on commit to master via Azure DevOps, and can be seen running [here](http://do-cakes-react.azurewebsites.net/)

Indicative unit tests have been added using Jest and Enzyme.
